    <h1>Welcome to your new web component.</h1>
    There are only three requirements to make a lit-element web component work all the way down to IE11:
    <ol>
      <li><code>@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs</code> is needed to enable custom elements in IE11 and Edge 18 and lower</li>
      <li>
        Rollup is needed because <code>[component-name]-entry.js</code> uses an import statement to pull in the [ComponentName] class from a separate file.<br/>
        IE11 doesn't support JS imports so this rollup is needed to bundle those two files into one.<br/>
        Rollup is also used to create a bundle for modern browsers that includes LitElement and all its dependencies.
      </li>
      <li>Babel is needed to compile the ES6 code down to ES5 code so IE11 will work</li>
    </ol>
